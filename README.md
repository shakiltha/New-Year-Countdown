# New-Year-Countdown
### Overview
Actually, I'm trying to build some **projects** so that my *html*, *css*, and *js* knowledge can take some space on the ground. From this project you'll have some idea to solve some real world problems. For example,
let's say
- your website is unavailable now and it'll start running after 7 days.
- there is an offer running and It'll end after 24 hours.

*there might be other cases for using countdown timer. But I'm unaware of those now*
### Feature
At first I thought I only count down from a certain *date*. But later I thought what other **feature** I can add to it. then I found why not change the color of second for every second count down. so there is two necessary **function** i've used to fulfill this goal. 
- one is for count down from a certain date of time.
- other is to generate random color for each second count down

here is the live demo [new-year-countdown](https://courageous-boba-816a17.netlify.app/)
